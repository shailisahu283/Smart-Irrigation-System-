## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to assist farmers in automating irrigation decisions using sensor data. By analyzing real-time sensor inputs, the model predicts whether three separate land parcels need irrigation.

## 📅 Week-wise Work Summary

### ✅ Week 1: Data Preprocessing and Random Forest Modeling
- Imported and cleaned the dataset (`irrigation_machine.csv`)
- Removed unnecessary columns and handled basic EDA
- Split data into **features** (`sensor_0` to `sensor_19`) and **targets** (`parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, `parcel_2`)
- Normalized data using `MinMaxScaler`
- Trained a **MultiOutput Random Forest Classifier**
- Saved the trained model and scaler for future inference

### ✅ Week 2: Model Evaluation and Visualization
- Evaluated the model using `classification_report` (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualized feature importance
- Visualized decision tree structure (shallow level)
- Explored dataset statistics and distribution
- Gained insights into which sensors most affect irrigation decisions

### 🔜 Future Work
- Integrate with **real-time IoT sensors**
- Add **time-series analysis** using LSTM or other temporal models
- Build a web dashboard or embedded interface for end-users
- Deploy model on microcontrollers (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino with ML support)

## 🧠 Why Random Forest?

- Handles **non-linear interactions** between sensor inputs
- Supports **multi-label output** using `MultiOutputClassifier`
- **Robust to noise** and missing data
- **No heavy preprocessing** required
- Provides **feature importance insights**
- Easily tunable and scalable
